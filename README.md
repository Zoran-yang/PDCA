# SOPPlus

## A mindsetting APP you have ever seen. Try trendy function by you own!

## Why I develop SOPPlus

When I delve into books or reflect upon the viewpoints of notable figures, I always have the intention to incorporate what I've learned and contemplated into my daily life. Yet, as time elapses, I often find myself falling back into my old patterns, resulting in minimal or no tangible benefits. This recurring scenario can be quite frustrating. To remedy this, I developed SOPPlus.
